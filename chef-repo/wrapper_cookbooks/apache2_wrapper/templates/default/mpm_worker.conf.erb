# worker MPM configuration
#
# Note that these values apply to Apache httpd before version 2.3.9/2.3.13 where MaxRequestsPerChild and MaxClients were renamed.
#    When we move to newer versions of Apache httpd we should remove this template and use the template contained in the apache2 cookbook.
#
# StartServers: initial number of server processes to start.  Default: 3
# MinSpareThreads: minimum number of worker threads which are kept spare (idle).  Default: 75
# MaxSpareThreads: maximum number of worker threads which are kept spare (idle).  Default: 250
# ThreadsPerChild: constant number of worker threads in each server process.  Default: 25
# MaxClients (renamed to MaxRequestWorkers in version 2.3.13): maximum number of request-handling threads for the server.
#             Any requests above that will be queued until a thread is available.
#             Default: ServerLimit * ThreadsPerChild
# MaxRequestsPerChild (renamed to MaxConnectionsPerChild in version 2.3.9): maximum number of requests a server process serves
# ThreadLimit: ThreadsPerChild can be changed to this maximum value during a graceful restart.
#             ThreadLimit can only be changed by stopping and starting Apache.  Default: 64
# ServerLimit: use this directive only if the MaxClients and ThreadsPerChild settings require more than 16 server processes (default).
#             Do not set the value of this directive any higher than the number of server processes required for MaxClients and ThreadsPerChild.
