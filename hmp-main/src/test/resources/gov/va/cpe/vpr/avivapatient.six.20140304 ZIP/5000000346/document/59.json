The \r\nthoughts have progressively worsened over the last week to the point where she \r\nnow has established a plan to take all of her medications at once with the \r\nintent of ending her life.  She came to the ER because she was afraid she would \r\nfollow through with her plan.  She denies thoughts of hurting others.\r\n\r\n-A/P: The MH crisis team was contacted and they visited with the patient.  They \r\nand the patient have agreed that the patient needs to be admitted to the \r\npsychiatry unit for close monitoring.  The patient will be admitted when a bed \r\nbecomes available.  She will be monitored with a 1:1 in the ER while she is \r\nwaiting for a bed.\r\n\r\n","dateTime":"201302151434","status":"completed","author":"AVIVAUSER,SEVEN","authorDisplayName":"Avivauser,Seven"}],"facilityCode":"500D","facilityName":"SLC-FO HMP DEV","localId":"4422","encounterUid":"urn:va:visit:F484:100847:7592","encounterName":"EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT Feb 15, 2013","referenceDateTime":"201302151434","documentTypeCode":"PN","documentTypeName":"Progress Note","documentClass":"PROGRESS NOTES","localTitle":"EMERGENCY ROOM PROVIDER","nationalTitle":{"title":"EMERGENCY DEPT E & M NOTE","vuid":"urn:va:vuid:4693739"},"clinicians":[{"uid":"urn:va:user:F484:1091","summary":"gov.va.cpe.vpr.DocumentClinician@193c803","name":"AVIVAUSER,SEVEN","displayName":"Avivauser,Seven","role":"A"},{"uid":"urn:va:user:F484:1091","summary":"gov.va.cpe.vpr.DocumentClinician@13066cc","name":"AVIVAUSER,SEVEN","displayName":"Avivauser,Seven","role":"S","signedDateTime":"20130220183310","signature":"SEVEN AVIVAUSER "}],"statusName":"completed","nationalTitleSetting":{"setting":"EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT","vuid":"urn:va:vuid:4696265"},"nationalTitleService":{"service":"EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT","vuid":"urn:va:vuid:4696230"},"nationalTitleType":{"type":"NOTE","vuid":"urn:va:vuid:4696120"}}
