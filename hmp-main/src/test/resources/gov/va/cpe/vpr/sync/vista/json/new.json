It is one of the most \r\nendangered cat species in the world.[2] According to the conservation group SOS \r\nLynx, if this species died out, it would be one of the few feline extinctions \r\nsince the Smilodon 10,000 years ago.[3] The species was formerly classified as a \r\nsubspecies of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), but is now considered a separate \r\nspecies. Both species occurred together in central Europe in the Pleistocene \r\nepoch, being separated by habitat choice.[4] The Iberian lynx is believed to \r\nhave evolved from Lynx issiodorensis.[5]\r\nContents\r\n\r\n    1 Description\r\n    2 Ecology\r\n    3 Reproduction\r\n    4 Habitat\r\n    5 Population\r\n        5.1 Conservation\r\n            5.1.1 SOS Lynx\r\n    6 References\r\n    7 External links\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nCloseup of the Iberian lynx\r\n\r\nIn most respects, the Iberian lynx resembles other species of lynx, with a short \r\ntail, tufted ears and a ruff of fur beneath the chin. While the Eurasian lynx \r\nbears rather pallid markings, the Iberian lynx has distinctive, leopard-like \r\nspots with a coat that is often light grey or various shades of light brownish-\r\nyellow. The coat is also noticeably shorter than in other lynxes, which are \r\ntypically adapted to colder environments.[6] Some western populations were \r\nspotless, although these have recently[when?] become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe head and body length is 85 to 110 centimetres (33 to 43 in), with the short \r\ntail an additional 12 to 30 centimetres (4.7 to 12 in); the shoulder height is \r\n60 to 70 centimetres (24 to 28 in). The male is larger than the female, with the \r\naverage weight of males 12.9 kilograms (28 lb) and a maximum of 26.8 kilograms \r\n(59 lb), compared to an average of 9.4 kilograms (21 lb) for females; this is \r\nabout half the size of the Eurasian lynx.[4][7][8]\r\nEcology\r\n\r\nThe Iberian lynx is smaller than its northern relatives, and typically hunts \r\nsmaller animals, usually no larger than hares. It also differs in habitat \r\nchoice, with Iberian lynx inhabiting open scrub and Eurasian lynx inhabiting \r\nforests.[4]\r\n\r\nIt hunts mammals (including rodents and insectivores), birds, reptiles and \r\namphibians at twilight. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is its main \r\nprey (79.5-86.7%), with (5.9%) hares (Lepus granatensis) and rodents (3.2%) less \r\ncommon.[4] A male requires one rabbit per day; a female bringing up cubs will \r\neat three rabbits per day.[9]\r\n\r\nAs the population of rabbits in Spain and Portugal has declined due to \r\nmyxomatosis, the Iberian lynx is often forced to attack young fallow deer, roe \r\ndeer, mouflon, and ducks. The Iberian lynx competes for prey with the red fox, \r\nthe Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) and the wildcat. It is solitary and \r\nhunts alone; it will stalk its prey or lie in wait for hours behind a bush or \r\nrock until the prey is sufficiently close to pounce in a few strides.\r\n\r\nA lynx, especially with younger animals, will roam widely, with ranges reaching \r\nmore than 100 kilometres (62 mi). Its territory (~ 10 to 20 square kilometres \r\n(3.9 to 7.7 sq mi)) is also dependent on how much food is available.[9] \r\nNonetheless, once established, ranges tend to be stable in size over many years, \r\nthe boundaries often being along man-made roads and trails. The Iberian lynx \r\nmarks its territory with its urine, droppings left in existing tracks through \r\nthe vegetation, and scratch marks on the barks of trees.[6]\r\nReproduction\r\nSpecimen in the Do√±ana National Park\r\n\r\nDuring the mating season the female leaves her territory in search of a male. \r\nThe typical gestation period is about two months; the cubs are born between \r\nMarch and September, with a peak of births in March and April. A litter consists \r\nof two or three (rarely one, four or five) kittens weighing between 200 and 250 \r\ngrams (7.1 and 8.8 oz).\r\n\r\nThe kittens become independent at seven to 10 months old, but remain with the \r\nmother until around 20 months old. Survival of the young depends heavily on the \r\navailability of prey species. In the wild, both males and females reach sexual \r\nmaturity at one year old, though in practice they rarely breed until a territory \r\nbecomes vacant; one female was known not to breed until five years old when its \r\nmother died. The maximum longevity in the wild is 13 years.[4][8]\r\n\r\nSiblings become violent towards one another between 30 and 60 days, peaking at \r\n45 days. A cub will frequently kill its littermate in a brutal fight. It is \r\nunknown why these episodes of aggression occur, though many scientists believe \r\nit is related to a change in hormones when a cub switches from its mother's milk \r\nto meat. Others believe it is related to hierarchy, and \"survival of the \r\nfittest.\" No matter the reason, conservationists must separate the kittens until \r\nthe 60 day period is reached.[citation needed]\r\nHabitat\r\n\r\nThis lynx was distributed over the entire Iberian Peninsula as recently as the \r\nmid-19th century. It is now restricted to very limited areas of southern Spain,\r\n[10] with breeding only confirmed in two areas of Andaluc√≠a. The Iberian lynx \r\nprefers heterogeneous environments of open grassland mixed with dense shrubs \r\nsuch as strawberry tree, mastic, and juniper, and trees such as holm oak and \r\ncork oak. It is now largely restricted to mountainous areas, with only a few \r\ngroups found in lowland forest or dense maquis shrubland.\r\nPopulation\r\nGraphic showing Iberian lynx population in Spain, 1950-2007\r\n\r\nThe Iberian lynx is a critically endangered species;[1] it is the world's most \r\nthreatened species of cat, and the most threatened carnivore in Europe.[11]\r\n\r\nStudies conducted in March 2005 estimated the number of surviving Iberian lynx \r\nto be as few as 100, down from about 400 in 2000[12] and down from 4,000 in \r\n1960.[13] If the Iberian lynx were to become extinct, it would be the first big \r\ncat species to do so since Smilodon populator 10,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe only breeding populations are in Spain, and were thought to be only living \r\nin the Do√±ana National Park and in the Sierra de And√∫jar, Ja√©n. However, in \r\n2007, Spanish authorities announced that they had discovered a previously \r\nunknown population in Castile-La Mancha (central Spain).[14] It was later \r\nannounced that there were around 15 individuals there.[15]\r\n\r\nThe Iberian lynx and its habitat are fully protected, and they are no longer \r\nlegally hunted. Its critical status is mainly due to habitat loss, poisoning, \r\nroad casualties, feral dogs and poaching. Its habitat loss is due mainly to \r\ninfrastructure improvement, urban and resort development and tree \r\nmonocultivation, which serves to break the lynx's distribution area. In \r\naddition, the lynx prey population of rabbits is also declining due to diseases \r\nsuch as myxomatosis and hemorrhagic pneumonia.[16]\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Do√±ana population was assessed at 24 to 33, with an estimated 60 to \r\n110 adults in the Sierra Morena, which is the stronghold of the species. The \r\ntotal population is estimated to be 99 to 158 adults, including the newly \r\ndiscovered La Mancha population, and the Iberian lynx qualifies as Critically \r\nEndangered under C2a(i) on the IUCN Redlist.[1]\r\n\r\nTo reduce the risk of having only two core populations, the conservation \r\ncommunity wants to reintroduce animals to other parts of Spain and Portugal. The \r\nCampanarios de Azaba area near Salamanca will be the first location and \r\nreintroduction is being discussed with the Ministry of Environment.[17]\r\nIberian lynx in close-up\r\nConservation\r\n\r\nRecent successful breeding programs have given renewed hope to survival of this \r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n    On March 29, 2005, Saliega, the first Iberian lynx to breed in captivity, \r\ngave birth to three healthy kittens at the El Acebuche Breeding Center, in the \r\nDo√±ana Nature Park in Huelva, Spain.[18] On March 22, 2008, Saliega gave birth \r\nto three more kittens at the El Acebuche centre. These kits were born at 64 days \r\ngestation. One of the young was rejected by the mother, and the Junta de \r\nAndaluc√≠a's Environment Department reported on March 24 that the rejected kitten \r\nhad died.[19]\r\n\r\n    In the Sierra Morena area just north of And√∫jar, Andaluc√≠a, there were 150 \r\nIberian lynx individuals overall in 2008, up from 60 in 2002. As a result of \r\nthis increase, the lynx area in And√∫jar-Carde√±a has probably reached its \r\ncarrying capacity, and thus could provide animals for future reintroductions \r\nelsewhere. In addition to these on-site conservation achievements in the Sierra \r\nMorena, the off-site conservation captive breeding program has also progressed \r\nwell, totaling 52 individuals, 24 of which were bred in captivity. The off-site \r\nconservation population will provide 20 to 40 individuals per year for \r\nreintroductions beginning in 2010.\r\n\r\n    In Do√±ana National Park, the lynx population seems to have remained steady \r\nin recent years, with around 50 individuals reported in total each year between \r\n2002 and 2008. In March 2009, the birth of three more kittens was announced; \r\nthey were born as part of the breeding program at Do√±ana National Park, in \r\nHuelva.[20] The Iberian Lynx is planned to be reintroduced into Guadalmellato \r\nbeginning in 2009, and into Guarrizas sometime in 2010 - 11.[2]\r\n\r\n    During the 2010\/2011 season, there were 45 kittens born in breeding centers, \r\nof which 26 survived.[21] In 2011\/2012, breeding centers in Portugal and Spain \r\nreported a total of 59 births with 44 surviving kittens.[21][22]\r\n\r\nSOS Lynx\r\n\r\nSOS Lynx is a conservation charity based in Portugal, working to prevent the \r\nextinction of the Iberian lynx. Its aim is to stop the decline of the Iberian \r\nlynx and other lynx species.[23][24][13]\r\n\r\n\r\nIriomote cat\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\nJump to: navigation, search\r\nIriomote cat\r\nTaxidermy specimen at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo\r\nConservation status\r\n\r\nCritically Endangered (IUCN 3.1)[1]\r\nScientific classification\r\nKingdom:        Animalia\r\nPhylum:         Chordata\r\nClass:  Mammalia\r\nOrder:  Carnivora\r\nFamily:         Felidae\r\nGenus:  Prionailurus\r\nSpecies:        P. bengalensis\r\nSubspecies:     P. b. iriomotensis\r\nTrinomial name\r\nPrionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis\r\n(Imaizumi, 1967)\r\nIriomote cat range\r\n\r\nThe Iriomote cat (Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis) is a subspecies of the \r\nleopard cat that lives exclusively on the Japanese island of Iriomote.

[16]Their necks are also thick, \r\nand their shoulders are muscular, though their jumping power is comparatively \r\nweak. Unlike other small cats, their spines cannot bend sharply.[16]\r\nA taxidermied Iriomote cat at the Iriomote Wildlife Conservation Center. It has \r\ndark gray and brown fur, rounded ears, light amber eyes, and a flattened nose.\r\n\r\nThe fur of the Iriomote cat is mostly dark gray and light brown, with the hair \r\non the stomach and insides of the limbs being lighter. Hair along the jaw is \r\nwhite.[16] On each cheek are two dark brown spots. Like the leopard cat, there \r\nare 5?7 stripes that span from the forehead to the back of the head, but unlike \r\nthe leopard cat the stripes stop before reaching the shoulders.[5][7][16] Dark \r\nbrown spots cover the sides of the body, and there are 3?4 bands of irregular \r\nstripes on the chest.[6][7] The tails are dark brown; darker spots pattern the \r\nback side of the tail while the underside of the tail is solid. The tip of the \r\ntail is dark. [16]\r\n\r\nThe tips of the ears are rounded, with black hair along the edge. There are no \r\n]}}mutations. Also, from the speed of cytochrome b's base-pair substitution and its \r\ndiversity, it is estimated that the Iriomote cat diverged from the leopard cat \r\naround 180,000-200,000 years ago.[22] According to marine geologists, the Ryukyu \r\nIslands were connected to mainland Asia via a land bridge from about 20,000 \r\nyears ago to 240,000 years ago. Scientists believe that the Iriomote cat moved \r\nits range to the islands during this period.[9] Because of this, it is assumed \r\nthat there is little genetic variety within the species.[11]\r\nEcology\r\n\r\nIriomote cats are nocturnal and especially active during the twilight hours.[6]\r\n[11] During the daytime, they sleep in the hollows of trees or in caves.[5][7] \r\nTheir ranges run from 1-7 square kilometers,[5][7][10] and they mark their \r\nterritory within their range by urinating and defecating on rocks, tree stumps, \r\nand bushes.[5][7] They are land mammals, but they do climb trees, go into the \r\nwater, and will even swim.[5][12][15]\r\nDiet\r\n\r\nIriomote cats are carnivorous and prey on various mammals, birds, reptiles, \r\namphibians, fish, and crustaceans. They typically ingest 400?600 grams of food a \r\nday.[15] Other types of wild cats will primarily hunt small mammals such as \r\nrodents and rabbits, but because there are no other carnivores to compete with \r\nthe Iriomote cat on the island, there is no need for them to isolate themselves \r\nfrom the various habitats and food sources that are available. Thus, their diet \r\nis quite varied.[23]\r\nSlaty-legged crakes make up a portion of Iriomote cats' diet\r\n\r\nMammals they eat include black rats, the Ryukyu flying fox, and young Ryukyu \r\nwild boar. Their prey also includes a wide range of birds such as the spot-\r\nbilled duck, slaty-legged crake, Eurasian scops-owl, pale thrush, and white-\r\nbreasted waterhen.[5][6][10][11] Reptiles include various types of snakes and \r\nKishinoue's great skink.[5][6][10][11][24] They are also known to eat Sakishima \r\nrice frogs, yellow-spotted crickets, and crabs.[5][6][10][11] As their hunting \r\ngrounds tend to be in swamps or on shores, they will sometimes swim and dive to \r\ncatch water birds, fish, and freshwater prawns.[15][23]\r\n\r\nWhen eating birds that are larger than a dusky thrush, most types of cats will \r\npluck the feathers and then eat it, but the Iriomote cat will eat even large \r\nbirds whole without removing the feathers.[15] Also unlike other cats, the \r\nIriomote cat will not kill its prey immediately by breaking the spinal cord. \r\nInstead it will hold the animal in its mouth until it stops moving.[5]\r\n\r\nBased on stool samples, birds appear in the Iriomote cat's diet about 60% of the \r\ntime, black rats 30%, insects 30%, lizards and frogs about 15-20%, bats 3?17%, \r\nand boar less than 1% of the time. In addition, fish and crustaceans appear \r\nroughly 3?4% of the time.[25][25][26] It is estimated that over a period of one \r\nyear, water birds will comprise about 60% of the cat's diet with black rats \r\nbeing its secondary source of food at about 10?30% per year.[25]\r\n\r\nSeasonal dietary changes have been observed. They will eat rats and frogs year-\r\nround, lizards in the summer and spring, and crickets and bats more often in \r\nfall and winter.[23]\r\nBreeding\r\n\r\nIriomote cats are most active at night and during twilight, but during the \r\nmating season they will become active during the day as well.[18] Breeding \r\nfemales are more active than nonbreeding ones during the late night and morning \r\nhours.[27] Moreover, outside of the mating season the cats will live in \r\nsolitary, but when they begin breeding they will act together.[18][25] The \r\nmating season lasts from December to March, and females will go into heat \r\nseveral times during this period, with the peak being in January and February.\r\n[10][25][27] Towards the end of February, they will fast for about two weeks. It \r\nis during this period that females will be most sexually excited. Male and \r\nfemale cats will always be together at this time, and it is thought that \r\nconception happens during these two weeks.[18]\r\n\r\nPregnancy is viviparous, and between April and June pregnant female cats will \r\ngive birth to 1?3 kittens in a tree hollow or cavern.[18][28] The locations \r\nchosen for birthing and rearing are dry and have good ventilation.[18] Kittens \r\nstay with their mother for about eleven months,[18] and they will begin to \r\nbecome more independent during the fall and winter months. They will stay in \r\ntheir mother's range from anywhere between a few months and years.[23] Kittens \r\nreach maturity twenty months after birth.[7]\r\nRange and territory\r\n\r\nIriomote cats are solitary animals, and their range varies seasonally and also \r\nindividually, however their range shrinks during the mating season. In 1998 and \r\n1999 a male and a female Iriomote cat were radio tracked for seven to thirteen \r\nsuccessive days in the western part of the island. Their home ranges overlapped \r\nextensively in all periods. The periodical home range of the male was 0.83?1.65 \r\nkm2 in size, and the resident female's range was 0.76?1.84 km2.[29][11][25]\r\n\r\nIriomote cats are very territorial and will not allow others into their area.\r\n[25] That said, males' and females' ranges do overlap, and one to two females \r\ntend to live within a single male's sphere.[25][28] Typically, cats of the same \r\ngender will not overlap their territories, but pallergyial overlaps are seen.[23]\r\n[25][28] Oftentimes these small overlaps are hunting grounds.[23] It is thought \r\nthat the cats make rounds of their territories lasting three to four days, \r\nmarking and hunting as they go.[25]\r\n\r\nYoung male Iriomote cats and some grown cats do not have a set territory. While \r\nwandering the island, they will wait for an opening in a territory and find an \r\narea where there is no other male cat. They will then mark this area for \r\nthemselves.[23][28] Female cats will allow their young to stay in their own \r\nrange and then mark a new territory once the next breeding season comes.[5][7]\r\nLifespan\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that Iriomote cats live for seven to eight years in the wild and \r\neight to nine years in captivity. [7][18] Because of human influences, though, \r\ntraffic accidents and traps may lower their lifespan to two to five years.[18] \r\nIn captivity, an Iriomote cat lived for an estimated fifteen years and one \r\nmonth, the longest known lifespan of any Iriomote cat (see #Yon).[30]\r\nIn captivity\r\n\r\nThere have been a handful of Iriomote cats kept in captivity. A five week old \r\nmale kitten that had been separated from its mother was found on June 14, 1979. \r\nHe was named Keita and was kept at the Okinawa Zoo until he died of old age at \r\napproximately thirteen years and two months of age.[18] A female specimen was \r\nalso kept at the National Museum of Nature and Science. She was believed to have \r\nbeen approximately nine years and seven months old when she died.[18] On August \r\n6, 1996, a male kitten that would later be known as Yon was taken into care at \r\nthe Iriomote Wildlife Protection Center after being involved in a traffic \r\naccident.[30]\r\nYon\r\nDiscovery and hospitalization\r\nThe taxidermied body of \"Yon\". He was hit by a car on August 6, 1996 then \r\nrehabilitated at the Iriomote Wildlife Conservation Center. He died on April 9, \r\n2011 at the estimated age of fifteen years and one month, the longest confirmed \r\nlifespan of any Iriomote cat.[30]\r\n\r\nOn August 6, 1996, a young Iriomote cat was involved in a traffic accident near \r\nNadara Bridge on the northern pallergy of the island. He weighed 1.6 kilograms and \r\nwas assumed to have been born in early March, making him about five months old. \r\nIt is possible that he had just been separated from his mother. The next morning \r\nhe had regained consciousness, but he wasn't able to regulate his body \r\ntemperature due to the serious injuries he received. He was transferred to \r\nIshigaki Island at 9 am to receive medical care at Ishigaki Veterinary Clinic. \r\nHe spent 24 days under their care.[31]\r\n\r\nFollowing the accident he couldn't move on his own, but he regained his ability \r\nto walk while on Ishigaki. He was brought back to the Iriomote Wildlife \r\nPreservation Center for rehabilitation on August 31. Originally labeled W-48 due \r\nto the fact that he was the forty-eighth confirmed sighting of an Iriomote cat \r\non the western pallergy of the island, he eventually was given the name Yon.[31]\r\nRehabilitation\r\n\r\nBy September 2, Yon weighed 1.9 kilograms. Despite his progress, his caretakers \r\nnoticed a tendency for him to turn to the right because of the effects of his \r\naccident.[31]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Yon's caretakers took careful measures in order to avoid \r\nacclimation to humans so that one day he could be released back into the wild. \r\nOnly three staff members were allowed to feed him directly. Other people, \r\nincluding center staff, were only allowed to view him via video camera \r\nmonitoring. The media were also prohibited from taking direct photographs.[31]\r\n\r\nFrom the time he was discharged until February 3, 1999 Yon's rehabilitation was \r\nrestricted to a room within the center. Thin logs were used to make a jungle gym \r\nso that he would be able to practice walking, jumping, and climbing trees. Rice \r\nplants were also grown in his room as a substitute for grass that cats use to \r\nhelp regurgitate. Once he was healthy enough, he was moved to an outdoor cage \r\nwhere he lived until his health began deteriorating on December 20, 2010.[31]\r\n\r\nHe was permanently handicapped after his accident; his left paw was paralyzed, \r\nand he tended to move towards the right.[31]\r\nDeath\r\n\r\nOn December 20, 2010 Yon was found to be curled up and unmoving near a dried \r\nstream. He was brought into the center's rehabilitation room, where it was \r\ndiscovered that he had pulmonary edema which had nearly killed him, however he \r\nwas able to eat by the next day and gradually got better. He was unable to walk \r\nfor the remainder of December, though by the end of January he regained his \r\nability to walk, and during February and March he improved enough to be able to \r\nwalk up and down stairs. However his condition then took a turn for the worse, \r\nand he died on the night of April 9 at an estimated fifteen years and one month \r\nold. He weighed 3.5 kilograms and was 78.5 centimeters long. He is the oldest \r\nIriomote cat on record.[31]\r\nInfluence on research\r\n\r\nYon was the first Iriomote cat to be kept for an extended period of time, the \r\nonly to be saved after an accident, and the first to go through rehabilitation. \r\nOther Iriomote cats that were rescued either died immediately or shortly after \r\nbeing brought in for care.[31]\r\n\r\nThough he was never returned to the wild, the recorded observations of Yon are \r\nextremely important regarding Iriomote cat preservation. Every day, records were \r\ntaken including what he did at what time, weight, and anything else of note. \r\nBecause of difficulties in researching Iriomote cats in the wild, observations \r\nof Yon are currently the best example of the cats' natural behavior. There are \r\nalso very few cases of the cats being cared for by people, so records of his \r\nhealth care may help injured and sick Iriomote cats in the future.[31]\r\nDiscovery\r\n\r\nThe Iriomote cat was officially discovered by Yukio Togawa (???? Togawa Yukio?), \r\nan author that specialized in works about animals, in 1965 and was later \r\ndescribed in 1967 by Dr. Yoshinori Imaizumi, director of the zoological \r\ndepallergyment of the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo.[32]\r\n\r\nPrior to its scientific discovery, the Iriomote cat was known locally by various \r\nnames: yamamaya (?????, ?the cat in the mountain?), yamapikarya- (????????, ?\r\nthat which shines on the mountain?), me-pisukarya- (?????????, ?that which has \r\nflashing eyes?). To distinguish between the Iriomote cat and other cats on the \r\nisland, locals also gave other cats nicknames such as pingimaya (??????) for \r\nstray cats and maya (???) or mayagwa- (??????) for house cats.[33][33][34] \r\nOthers, however, believed that the Iriomote cats may have just been feral cats.\r\n[5][6]\r\nPrior to specimen acquisition\r\n\r\nBased on information from the locals, Tetsuo Koura (???? Koura Tetsuo) from \r\nUniversity of the Ryukyus was able to capture a kitten in 1962, but he wasn't \r\nable to get an adult specimen.[5] In 1964, Tokio Takano (???? Takano Tokio) from \r\nthe exploration depallergyment of Waseda University informed Yoshinori Imaizumi of \r\nthe rumors of a cat living in the mountains of Iriomote.[16]\r\n\r\nIn February of 1965 Togawa visited the Yaeyama Islands. He had heard in Naha \r\nfrom a newspaper columnist that there were rumors of wild cats living on \r\nIriomote.[34] He at first assumed that, like reports of the extinct Japanese \r\nwolf, people must have been mistaking escaped and feral house pets for wild \r\nanimals. He spoke with colleague Tetsuo Koura who knew of and believed there to \r\nbe some truth to the rumors. Koura then entrusted Togawa with the task of \r\nacquiring evidence.[16][34] Togawa then traveled to Iriomote to gather \r\ninformation for his own report and to collect information on the Iriomote cat \r\nand a specimen.[34]\r\n\r\nUpon arriving on the island, Togawa learned that because there wasn't enough \r\nfood on Iriomote, people would cook Iriomote cats that had been caught and use \r\nthe meat in soup. Cats caught in traps would also be disposed of, which made \r\nacquiring samples difficult.[34]\r\n\r\nFollowing these discoveries, he went to the hamlet of Amitori (???? Amitori \r\nBuraku) on the western side of the island. There, a middle school teacher who \r\nhad worked under Koura said that he had caught one of the cats in a trap set for \r\nwild boar. He had sent the skin to Koura but buried the rest of the body. Togawa \r\ndug up the remains and got the skull. He also found two feces samples near the \r\nvillage, and was able to get a skin from a fisherman who lived in Inaba (????? \r\nInaba Buraku), a hamlet along Urauchi River.[34]\r\n\r\nHe returned to Koura and sent the two skins, the feces, and the skull to \r\nYoshinori Imaizumi at the National Museum of Nature and Science where the The \r\nMammalogical Society of Japan (???????? Nihon Honyu- Do-butsu Gakkai) tested the \r\nsubjects.[34] The analysis took place on March 14, 1965.[16] The results showed \r\nthe cat to be either a new species or a new subspecies, but there weren't enough \r\nsamples to confirm. They requested either a complete set of remains or a live \r\nspecimen.[16] Following the announcement, some members of the society believed \r\nthe samples to show simple mutations while others believed them to be the \r\nremains of wild cats that had previously been brought to and left on the island \r\nby foreign ships.[34]\r\nLive specimen acquisition to announcement\r\n\r\nIn June of 1965, Togawa returned to Iriomote with Koura in order to obtain a \r\ncomplete set of remains, a live specimen, and information regarding the cat's \r\necology. They brought box traps and silvervine to aid their efforts in catching \r\na live cat. According to hunters, though, only one or two cats per year were \r\ncaught, and the number of remaining cats was probably quite low. Togawa did not \r\nexpect to catch one alive.[35]\r\nMa-re- Waterfall, where a group of children found an Iriomote cat on May 5, 1965\r\n\r\nOn May 5, 1965, prior to Togawa's return to the island, a group of children from \r\nO-hara Elementary School (?????) on a field trip to the southern pallergy of the \r\nisland found a weakened, injured male Iriomote cat at the base of the small Ma-\r\nre- Waterfall (????? Ma-re- Taki) on Haemita Beach (?????? Haemita no Hama). The \r\nteacher in charge of the children took the cat. Another teacher preserved the \r\npelt in formalin and buried the skeleton in a wooden box behind the school. \r\nTogawa exhumed the remains, and this cat became the prototype for the species.\r\n[16][35] In addition to this example, the scientists also were able to obtain \r\nthe crushed skull of a kitten from the neighboring Yubu Island that was later \r\nreconstructed by Imaizumi.[35]\r\n\r\nIn addition to researching the Iriomote cat, Togawa also looked into rumors of a \r\nlarger cat on the island (see #Yamapikarya-) and conducted an investigation.[35] \r\nBefore returning to Tokyo, he offered $100 for any live Iriomote cat and $30 for \r\ndead cats that were brought to him. With the aid of the Taketomi mayor and the \r\nDaily Yaeyama Newspaper (??????? Yaeyama Mainichi Shinbun), he was able to \r\npublicize the offer on bulletin boards and in other ways.[36] He also announced \r\nrewards for the rumored large cat on the island: $200 if brought in alive, $100 \r\nfor remains.[36]\r\n\r\nThrough these offers, he acquired two complete skeletons, two skulls, and three \r\npelts that he brought back with him to Tokyo. One of the pelts was that which \r\nthe elementary school children helped obtain, and it was confirmed to be that of \r\nan Iriomote cat. The sample from Yubu Island was small, and judgment was held \r\nback. A sample from Ishigaki Island was discovered to be a house cat.[36]\r\n\r\nIn January of 1966, the body of an Iriomote cat that had been caught in a wild \r\nboar trap in the mid-basin of the Nakama River (??? Nakama-gawa) was sent to \r\nKoura at the University of the Ryukyus, but there was no more information \r\nregarding captures for some time after this.[36] In December of 1966, Hiroshi \r\nKuroda (??? Kuroda Hiroshi), a hunter at the Nakama River's mid-basin, caught a \r\nlive male cat, but it escaped immediately.[36] He then caught another male cat \r\nsoon after.[16]\r\n\r\nOn January 15, 1966, local hunters caught a young female Iriomote cat near \r\nNakama Mountain (??? Nakama-yama).[16][36] The National Museum of Nature and \r\nScience planned on using funds intended for garden repairs to pay for the \r\nspecimens, but the hunters who caught the cats expected $1000?$3000 per cat.[36] \r\nAt the persuasion of the director of the District Forestry Office, the hunters \r\naccepted an award within the budget as a ?daily allowance? or ?finder's fee?.\r\n[36]\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the mayor of Taketomi was making negotiations with the \r\nSouthern Japan Liaison Offices (??????? Nanpo- Renraku Jimusho) and the Ryukyu \r\ngovernment. He traveled to Naha for these discussions, which covered the \r\npossibility of offering the two captured Iriomote cats to the emperor with the \r\nstated purpose of increasing national knowledge about Iriomote and for the \r\npromotion of industrial development on the island. At the same time, the \r\nTaketomi town offices, under the premise of obtaining permission from the Ryukyu \r\ngovernment to keep the cats, confiscated samples from the staff of the National \r\nMuseum of Nature and Science and brought them back to their offices.[36]\r\n\r\nWith Togawa pressuring the newspapers and Yoshinori Imaizumi urging the Ryukyuan \r\ngovernment and Southern Japan Liaison Offices through the Ministry of Education, \r\nthe Southern Japan Liaison Offices denied the possibility of giving the cats to \r\nthe emperor, and the Ryukyuan government persuaded the mayor not to follow \r\nthrough with his plans. Finally, the specimens were delivered to the museum.[36]\r\n\r\nThe cats arrived at Haneda airport on March 20, 1967.[36] Yoshinori Imaizumi \r\nkept them shortly until Togawa, having been entrusted by the museum to observe \r\nthem, took charge of them for about two years.[16][37] The cats were then \r\ntransferred to the museum for monitoring. The male died on April 25, 1973 and \r\nthe female on December 13, 1975. The male's pelt was temporarily stuffed, the \r\nblood was sent off for chromosomal research, and the rest of the body was \r\npreserved in formaldehyde. The female was stuffed and put on display in the \r\nmuseum.[16]\r\n\r\nIn May of 1967, The Mammalogical Society of Japan issued their third and fourth \r\nissues, announcing in English the discovery of a new genus of cat that was \r\nclosely related to the primitive Metailurus genus of cats.[16] The former genus \r\nname of Mayailurus stems from the word used for ?cat? on Iriomote, maya-, while \r\n-ailurus comes ancient Greek and also means ?cat?.[16] The subspecies name of \r\niriomotensis means ?from Iriomote?.[16] The Japanese name of Togawa mountain cat \r\n(??????? Togawa-yamaneko) was proposed by Yoshinori Imaizumi, in honor of Togawa \r\nwho discovered the species, but Togawa turned down the request and instead \r\nsupported the name Iriomote cat (????????? Iriomote-yamaneko) based on the \r\nTsushima cat, which was also named after the location at which it was \r\ndiscovered. Koura agreed with Togawa, thus officiating the name.[34]\r\nRelationship with humans\r\nSign warning motorists of animals, with a picture of an Iriomote cat\r\n\r\nDestruction of habitat due to development, predation by dogs, traffic accidents, \r\nand traps set for wild boar and crabs all contribute to the decline in number of \r\nIriomote cats.[5][7][10] During the second survey of the island, conducted from \r\n1982?1984, it was estimated that 83?108 Iriomote cats lived on the island. The \r\nthird survey, conducted from 1993?1994, estimated that 99?110 of the cats were \r\non the island. During the fourth survey, conducted from 2005?2007, there were an \r\nestimated 100?109 remaining cats.[11][2] The method of estimating the numbers \r\ndiffered between the third and fourth surveys, though; if the third estimate \r\nwere to be revised, there would have been an estimated 108?118 Iriomote cats at \r\nthe time, meaning that the population is shrinking over time.[2]\r\nConservation status\r\n\r\nAccording to the IUCN, leopard cats (P. bengalensis) are categorized under \r\n?least concern?,[38] but the subspecies Iriomote cat (P. b. iriomotensis) was \r\noriginally listed as ?endangered?. [1] An assessment done in 2008 updated its \r\nstatus to ?critically endangered? because of its habitat being limited to \r\nIriomote Island and a decrease in numbers.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Iriomote cat was designated as a natural monument by the Okinawan \r\ngovernment.[36] On May 15, 1972, along with the recovery of Okinawa, it was \r\nnationally recognized as a natural monument. On March 15, 1977, it was given \r\nspecial status amongst natural monuments, and in 1994 with the Species \r\nProtection Act, it was designated as a Specified National Endangered Species of \r\nWild Fauna and Flora (?????????? Kokunai Kisho- Yasei Do-shokubutsu-shu).[8][11]\r\n[39] This act was adopted on January 28 and enacted on March 1. [40]\r\nAdministrative actions\r\n\r\nIn 1977, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh wrote a letter addressed to Crown \r\nPrince Akihito regarding the preservation of the Iriomote cat. The report \r\nattached to the letter (written by Professor Leyhausen) suggested outlawing any \r\nfurther migration to the island as well as banning the cultivation of the land.\r\n[18] In response, Crown Prince Akihito said that he wished for a way that would \r\nallow for the preservation of the cats and the continued habitation of people on \r\nthe island. He also explained that the prime minister at the time, Takeo Fukuda, \r\nwas considering the implementation of a wildlife sanctuary on Iriomote.[18]\r\nSign warning motorists of Iriomote cats. The number is used in reporting \r\nsightings of the cat.\r\n\r\nIn 1972, the National Museum of Nature and Science prepared for its research \r\ninto the ecology of Iriomote cats, and in November of 1973 the World Wide Fund \r\nfor Nature and the Ministry of the Environment conducted a joint preliminary \r\ninvestigation regarding the cat's ecology,[16][2] and from 1974 the Ministry of \r\nthe Environment conducted a comprehensive investigation that lasted three years. \r\nAfter that, there were three more investigations beginning in 1982, 1992, and \r\n2005.[2]\r\n\r\nIn 1979 the EPA began a three-year-long feeding operation in order to increase \r\nthe survival rate of kittens,[18] but these actions have received some \r\ncriticism.[7]\r\n\r\nSince the Iriomote cat's discovery, various investigations have taken place. In \r\n2006, automatic cameras and radio telemetry were used in order to understand the \r\ncats' state of life. Pathological tests regarding the contagiousness of diseases \r\nwere also conducted, and tests on feces and food leftovers were also done. They \r\nalso compiled records of cat sightings by locals and tourists.[23]\r\n\r\nPallergy of the Iriomote's cat range was designated as Iriomote Ryukyu Government \r\nPark (??????? Iriomote Seifu Ko-en) on April 18, 1972. With the US's return of \r\nthe Ryukyu Islands to Japanese control on May 15, it became Iriomote National \r\nPark, and in March of 1991 11,584.67 hectares of the island was designated the \r\nIriomote Forest and Ecological Preserve (???????????? Iriomote-jima Shinrin \r\nSeitaikei Hogo Chiiki) in order to protect the natural environment within the \r\narea's confines.[41][42] Despite these efforts, not enough land within the \r\ncats' preferred habitat of 200 meters below sea level was included. In 1995 the \r\nIriomote Wildlife Preservation Center (???????????? Iriomote Yaseisei Seibutsu \r\nHogo Senta-) was established to increase preservation work, enforce research, \r\nand to increase understanding of the cats.[11]\r\n\"Zebra zone\" strips and inclined ditches on an Iriomote road\r\n\r\nSince the US returned control of the Ryukyu Islands to Japan in 1972, \r\ndevelopment on Iriomote continued with finances from the Okinawan mainland. In \r\n1977 a prefectural road was built that circles half of the island, which has led \r\nto a few Iriomote cat deaths every year caused by traffic accidents.[18] The \r\nMinistry of the Environment as well as the governments of Okinawa and Taketomi \r\nTown began installing road signs to warn people of Iriomote cats, tunnels \r\nbeneath the road for animals' safe crossing, zebra zones which create loud \r\nnoises when cars ride over them, wide ditches on the sides of roads, and ditches \r\non the side of the road that are inclined on one side in order to improve the \r\npreservation of the cats.[11][43] However, many residents have objected to \r\nrestrictions on land cultivation and improvement brought about by the measures \r\nin place to protect the Iriomote cat and other species on the island.[18]\r\nProblems with other animals\r\n\r\nAlong with the aforementioned traffic accidents, logging due to development, and \r\ndevelopment of the swamplands, house pets are also causing problems. House cats \r\nand stray cats especially cause issues with competition, disease transmission, \r\nand genetic pollution due to hybrids born of inter-species breeding. It is also \r\nfeared that dogs prey on the Iriomote cats.[10][11]\r\nIriomote Wildlife Conservation Center\r\n\r\nThe primary fear stems from house cats that have become feral or pallergyially \r\nferal, but monitoring of these interactions have not been made. Pressure from \r\ncompetition over food, contact with house cats that have contracted feline \r\nimmunodeficiency virus (FIV) and other contagious diseases, as well as decrease \r\nin population due to hybridization are all important issues with the Iriomote \r\ncat.[10]\r\n\r\nIn June of 1999, the Iriomote Wildlife Protection Center conducted an \r\ninvestigation among 50 house and feral cats and 23 Iriomote cats in order to see \r\nif FIV was being transmitted within the populations. FIV was not seen in any of \r\nthe Iriomote cats, but three of the house and feral cats tested positive.[44] \r\nBecause of the fears regarding transmission of the disease, stallergying in 2001 \r\nTaketomi Town enacted the Cat Breeding Ordinance which required all residents to \r\nregister their pet cats. In June of 2008, the ordinance was revised to include \r\nmandatory FIV testing and vaccinations, spaying and neutering, and \r\nmicrochipping. A new limit to the number of pets allowed per owner was also \r\nadded.[45]\r\n\r\nFurthermore the cane toad, which secretes a poisonous liquid from glands in its \r\nears, has also appeared on the island. In order to prevent further contamination \r\nof Iriomote, residents of Ishigaki Island began extermination measures in 2008.\r\n[46][47]\r\nMascot character\r\n\r\nOn July 30, 2010, the Taketomi Town Tourist Association invited residents to \r\ncreate a design for a local mascot. A Komi Elementary School sixth grader's \r\ndesign, which was based on the Iriomote cat, was chosen. The island of Iriomote, \r\nwhere Taketomi is located, is pictured on the mascot's chest. It was named in \r\nthe same manner it was designed; on August 31, 2010 the name ?Pikarya-? was \r\nchosen based on the submission of an Ishigaki resident who drew inspiration from \r\nthe local nickname of the cat, yamapikarya-. [48]\r\nYamapikarya-\r\n\r\nIn general, names such as yamapikarya- are used in reference to the Iriomote \r\ncat, but some locals claim to have seen another type of cat on the island. This \r\ncat is described as being twice as large as a house cat with a tail that is 60 \r\ncentimeters long and a coat pattern that is different than what the Iriomote cat \r\ndisplays. It has been sited several times.[33] Locals have given it several \r\nnicknames. In the neighborhoods of Sonai and Komi they call it kunzumaya- \r\n(???????) and toutouyaa (???????), respectively, and on Aragusu Island they call \r\nit yamapikarya- (????????). It is not thought to be a house cat, stray cat, or \r\nan Iriomote cat.[33][49]\r\n\r\nIn 1965 Togawa spoke with a local hunter who claimed to have killed a large cat \r\nwith fur like a tiger's. He disposed of the body, and Haemi on the southern pallergy \r\nof the island, where the body was disposed of, was searched.[35] The hunter said \r\nthat until ten days prior to the interview, the cat's skeleton was still where \r\nhe had left it, but the recent rains had washed it away.[35] He described that \r\ncat as having a shoulder height that reached an adult human's knee, a tail that \r\nwas 60 centimeters long, a body twice as large as a house cat's, and greenish \r\nstriped fur.[35]\r\n\r\nOn June 2, 1982 the Yomiuri Shimbun published an allergyicle about yamapikarya-. An \r\nexperienced boar hunter claimed to have seen yamapikarya- about ten times in the \r\nmountains around Mount Dedou. He also said that he caught and ate one once. On \r\nanother occasion, he said he saw an adult female yamapikarya- with a kitten.[33]\r\n\r\nOther allergyicles regarding yamapikarya- have also been published, including on \r\nSeptember 14, 2007. Professor Eiyuu Akiyoshi (???? Akiyoshi Eiyuu) of Shimane \r\nUniversity, who was staying on Iriomote in order to research fish, spotted a cat \r\nlarger than the Iriomote cat with a long tail and spots. He saw the cat on \r\nSakiyama Peninsula (???? Sakiyama Hanto-) on the seldom-visited western pallergy of \r\nthe island.[50]\r\n\r\nTadaaki Imaizumi (???? Imaizumi Tadaaki), on the other hand, spoke with a hunter \r\nin 1994 who had the skull of what he believed was a large wild cat. Tadaaki \r\nImaizumi determined that it was a house cat.[33]\r\n\r\nIn general, an increase in body size will result in an increase in range for any \r\ngiven species.[33] An Iriomote cat will have a range of 6.5 square kilometers; \r\ncomparing the Iriomote cat's size to yamapikarya-'s, it has been estimated that \r\na yamapikarya- would require about 30 square kilometers for its range. Iriomote \r\nIsland is about 290 square kilometers, meaning only about ten yamapikarya- could \r\nlive on the island.[33]\r\n",
