 ;;The available actions at the eHMP Dashboard's main screen include:
 ;;
 ;;U = Update Dashboard, to refresh the main screen. This is the

 ;;V = View HMP Nodes, to inspect the main eHMP data nodes currently
 ;;    stored in the ^XTMP or ^TMP globals.
 ;;J = Job Listing, to inspect the polling jobs and extract batches.
 ;;S = Sync Processes, to switch to the Sync-process Screen.
 ;;E = Errors, to switch to the Errors Screen.
 ;;H = History, to switch to the History Screen.
 ;;C = Change Auto-update Rate, to change the frequency with which
 ;;    the dashboard screens refresh. (This change covers all screens,
